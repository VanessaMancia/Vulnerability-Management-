## The main goal of vulnerability management is to mitigate risk to what your organization deems acceptable.

## In this lab, we will use OpenVAS, an open-source vulnerability tool, to scan a vulnerable Windows VM. We will do a credentialed and uncredentialed scan of the affected host machine to see the differences between both of these scans. 


# Phase 1 - Setting up our Scanner in Azure 

## The First thing we will do is go to portal.azure.com once we are there we will search for "marketplace" and once we are in the marketplace search "OpenVAS" > OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED

## > Start with a pre-set configuration > Dev/Test

## Now we will create our VM with the following:
### Resource group: Vulnerability-Management 
### VM Name: OpenVAS in the region of East US 2
### Authentication with password 
### Monitor: Disable boot diagnostics 

## Once we hit "create" we can go to the search bar and type in "VM" or go to resources

## Now that we have finished our OpenVAS VM we will SSH with it using Powershell since I am on a Windows computer. If you are on a Mac you can use Terminal to SSH into your VM. Remember we will SSH into our VM with the credentials we created earlier for our OpenVAS VM.
